excerpt: 'This study examines neurophysiological sex differences in autism, focusing on early stages of face processing. Using an event-related potentials (ERP) paradigm, the research reveals that autistic females show a distinct neurophysiological profile, positioned between autistic males and non-autistic females. These findings suggest that autistic females may have different neural processing patterns, potentially contributing to underdiagnosis. The study calls for further exploration of sex-specific compensatory mechanisms and the concept of camouflaging in autism.'

## Purpose of the paper:  

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether differences in socio-cognitive abilities between autistic males and females are rooted in distinct neurophysiological functioning. Given that autistic females are often underdiagnosed, potentially due to superior socio-cognitive abilities, the researchers aimed to explore sex-specific neurophysiological responses during face processing.

## Key findings include:  

Autistic females displayed a neurophysiological profile that fell between that of autistic males and non-autistic females, as shown by event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded during a spatially filtered faces oddball paradigm.
These findings suggest that neurophysiological sex differences in autism manifest from the initial stages of face processing, with autistic females exhibiting a unique profile compared to both autistic males and non-autistic individuals.
The study emphasizes the importance of further investigating sex-specific compensatory mechanisms in autism, particularly camouflaging, and how these may contribute to underdiagnosis in autistic females.
Overall, this research underscores the need for a clearer understanding of neurophysiological sex differences in autism, which may aid in refining diagnostic practices and improving support for autistic females.
