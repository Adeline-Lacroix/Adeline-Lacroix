excerpt: 'This study investigates predictive processes in face processing in autistic individuals, focusing on how spatial frequencies influence the detection of fearful faces. The results reveal that autistic individuals, regardless of sex, show behavioral differences in fear detection compared to non-autistic individuals. However, the study highlights significant sex differences, suggesting that autistic females may engage different neural mechanisms than males during face processing.'

Purpose of the paper and findings:  

The purpose of this study was to examine how predictive processes in face processing, specifically the role of spatial frequencies, differ in autistic individuals compared to non-autistic (NA) individuals. We aimed to test whether autistic females exhibit a more typical coarse-to-fine (CtF) processing of socio-emotional stimuli than autistic males, given that autistic females often have better socio-communicational skills.

Key findings include:  

Autistic individuals demonstrated lower accuracy and slower reaction times for detecting fearful faces compared to NA participants, regardless of the filtering order (coarse-to-fine or fine-to-coarse).
Both groups showed typical early-stage visual processing (P100 latency and N170 amplitude) based on the filtering order.
Autistic participants exhibited reduced differences in brain activity between the CtF and fine-to-coarse (FtC) filtering orders in the fusiform area, suggesting atypical modulation of spatial frequencies.
Autistic females displayed more spatially spread activation patterns compared to NA females, indicating distinct neural mechanisms.
The study also identified sex-specific differences, with females showing faster visual processing and stronger occipital activation for fine-to-coarse sequences than males, irrespective of autism diagnosis.
These findings suggest that while autism does not necessarily impair predictive processing from low spatial frequencies, there is reduced brain modulation by spatial frequency. The observed sex differences underscore the importance of considering sex-related factors when studying face processing in autism, especially in autistic females.
