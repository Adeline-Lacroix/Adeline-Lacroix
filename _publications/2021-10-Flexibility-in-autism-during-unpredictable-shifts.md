excerpt: 'This study explores flexibility difficulties in autism using two tasks: one involving real-life-like unpredictable shifts of socio-emotional stimuli, and another with predictable shifts of simple stimuli. The findings reveal that autistic individuals experience greater difficulty with unpredictable shifts in complex emotional tasks, but not with predictable shifts of character stimuli. Additionally, sex differences emerged, with autistic females outperforming autistic males in certain conditions. These results highlight the importance of factors like task predictability, explicitness, and sex in understanding flexibility challenges in autism.'

## Purpose of the paper:   

The purpose of this study was to examine flexibility difficulties in autistic individuals using tasks that reflect real-life challenges. By comparing performance on an unpredictable Emotional Shifting Task and a predictable Task Switching Task using character stimuli. We aimed to explore the role of predictability, stimulus type, and sex in flexibility difficulties associated with autism.  

## Key findings include:  

- Autistic individuals exhibited a larger switch cost (i.e., slower response times in shift versus non-shift conditions) on the Emotional Shifting Task compared to typically developing adults, indicating greater difficulty with unpredictable shifts of socio-emotional stimuli.
- However, there were no significant differences between the groups on the more explicit and predictable Task Switching Task, suggesting that flexibility difficulties in autism are influenced by the nature of the task.
- Sex differences were also observed: females responded faster than males in the Emotional Shifting Task. Additionally, in the Task Switching Task, typically developing males responded faster than females, while in the autistic group, females showed an advantage over males.  

These findings suggest that flexibility difficulties in autism are modulated by factors such as task predictability, the explicitness of shift rules, stimulus complexity, and sex. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing more targeted interventions to support autistic individuals in real-life situations.
