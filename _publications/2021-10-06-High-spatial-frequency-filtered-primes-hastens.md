excerpt: 'This study explores the role of spatial frequencies in emotional face recognition in autism. While Low Spatial Frequencies (LSF) typically generate predictions for fast face recognition, autistic individuals may show impairments in this process. The study compared the effects of LSF and High Spatial Frequencies (HSF) primes on the emotional Stroop task in autistic and non-autistic adults. Surprisingly, both groups processed faces faster with HSF primes, with autistic participants showing unique processing patterns for happy versus angry faces. These findings suggest low-level processing differences in autism without corroborating LSF predictive impairments.'

## Purpose of the paper:

The aim of this study was to investigate whether autistic individuals show alterations in predictive processes during emotional face recognition, particularly in relation to Low Spatial Frequencies (LSF) processing. 
Using an emotional Stroop task with spatially filtered primes (LSF vs. High Spatial Frequencies, HSF), we analyzed the performance of autistic and non-autistic adults using both bayesian linear mied models and diffusion models.

## Key findings include:  

- Contrary to the hypothesis, HSF primes led to faster face categorization than LSF primes in both groups, challenging the assumption that LSF drives predictive processes for fast recognition.
- Autistic participants exhibited a stronger advantage for HSF over LSF primes when processing happy faces, while non-autistic participants showed a stronger advantage for angry faces.
- Drift diffusion modeling confirmed the HSF advantage and revealed a longer non-decision time (e.g., encoding) in autistic individuals, suggesting specific low-level processing differences in autism.  

Although the study did not confirm LSF predictive impairments in autism, it provides insight into unique perceptual processing patterns in autistic individuals, particularly in their differential response to emotional stimuli. This contributes to understanding how low-level visual processing influences socio-emotional challenges in autism.
