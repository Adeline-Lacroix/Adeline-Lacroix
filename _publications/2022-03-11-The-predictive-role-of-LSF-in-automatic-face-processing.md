excerpt: 'This study explores the predictive role of low versus high spatial frequencies in automatic face processing. Using a visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) paradigm, the research shows that low spatial frequencies (LSF) are crucial in early face processing, generating fewer prediction errors than high spatial frequencies (HSF). The findings suggest that while both LSF and HSF contribute to face processing, HSF plays a more significant role in detecting changes in faces at later stages, particularly in the fusiform gyrus.'

## Purpose of the paper:  

The purpose of this study was to investigate the predictive role of low spatial frequencies (LSF) versus high spatial frequencies (HSF) during automatic face processing. Based on the coarse-to-fine model of visual processing, where LSF provide early coarse information to generate predictions and HSF convey fine details, we aimed to determine whether LSF play a crucial role in the predictive mechanisms underlying automatic face processing.

## Key findings include:  

Both LSF and HSF deviants elicited a mismatch response (visual mismatch negativity or vMMN), indicating that both spatial frequencies contribute to automatic face processing.
However, in line with the hypothesis, LSF deviants generated significantly reduced prediction errors (smaller mismatch responses) compared to HSF deviants, particularly at later stages of processing.
The difference in mismatch responses between HSF and LSF conditions was most pronounced in posterior brain areas and the right fusiform gyrus, suggesting that while LSF are important for generating early predictions, HSF could be more critical for conscious detection of changes in faces.
These findings highlight the predictive role of LSF in early stages of automatic face processing and emphasize the involvement of HSF, particularly in the fusiform gyrus, in conscious recognition and detection of facial changes.
