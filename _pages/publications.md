## Reduced spatial frequency differentiation and sex-related specificities in fearful face detection in autism: insights from EEG and the predictive brain model

This study investigates predictive processes in face processing in autistic individuals, focusing on how spatial frequencies influence the detection of fearful faces. 
The results reveal that autistic individuals, regardless of sex, show behavioral and neurophysiological differences in fear detection compared to non-autistic individuals. 
The study also highlights significant sex differences, suggesting that autistic females may engage different neural mechanisms than males during face processing.

## Sex modulation of faces prediction error in the autistic brain

This study examines neurophysiological sex differences in autism, focusing on early stages of face processing. 
Using a Mismatch Negativity paradigm in EEG, the research reveals that autistic females show a distinct neurophysiological profile, positioned between autistic males and non-autistic females. 
The findings suggest that autistic females may have different neural processing patterns and calls for further exploration of sex-specific compensatory mechanisms in autism.

## The predictive role of low spatial frequencies in automatic face processing: A visual mismatch negativity investigation

This study explores the predictive role of low versus high spatial frequencies in automatic face processing. 
Using a visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) paradigm, the research shows that low spatial frequencies (LSF) are crucial in early face processing, generating fewer prediction errors than high spatial frequencies (HSF). 
The findings suggest that while both LSF and HSF contribute to face processing, HSF plays a more significant role in detecting changes in faces at later stages, particularly in the fusiform gyrus.

## Flexibility in autism during unpredictable shifts of socio-emotional stimuli: Investigation of group and sex differences

This study explores flexibility difficulties in autism using two tasks: one involving real-life-like unpredictable shifts of socio-emotional stimuli, and another with predictable shifts of simple stimuli. 
The findings reveal that autistic individuals experience greater difficulty than non-autistic individuals with unpredictable shifts in complex emotional tasks, but not with predictable shifts of character stimuli. 
Additionally, sex differences emerged. 
The results highlight the importance of factors like task predictability, explicitness, and sex in understanding flexibility challenges in autism.

## High spatial frequency filtered primes hasten happy faces categorization in autistic adults

This study explores the role of spatial frequencies in emotional face recognition in autism. 
While Low Spatial Frequencies (LSF) could help in generating predictions for fast face recognition, autistic individuals may have atypical spatial frequency processing. 
The study compared the effects of LSF and High Spatial Frequencies (HSF) primes during an emotional Stroop task in autistic and non-autistic adults. 
Surprisingly, both groups processed faces faster with HSF primes, with autistic participants showing unique processing patterns for happy versus angry faces. 
The findings suggest low-level processing differences in autism compared to non-autistic idnividuals without corroborating specificities related to LSF predictive processing.
