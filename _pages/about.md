## Sex and Gender Differences in Autism
My research focused on autism, with a particular interest in understanding and characterizing sex and gender differences in the condition. Historically, autistic females have been underdiagnosed and under-researched, resulting in challenges in accessing appropriate care. By describing their specific profiles, we can help ensure better diagnosis and support for them.

During my PhD at the [Laboratory of Psychology and NeuroCognition (LPNC)](https://lpnc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en) in Grenoble, France, I studied these differences in the context of emotional face processing through the lens of the predictive brain model. My supervisors were Prof. Martial Mermillod (Grenoble, France) and Dr. Marie Gomot (Tours, France). I conducted behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) experiments.

In my first postdoctoral position at the LPNC, under the supervision of Prof. Monica Baciu and Dr. Marcela Perrone-Bertolotti, I further explored sex and gender differences in autism in relation to school participation. We also launched the FLEXPREAU project, which aims to better understand the neural mechanisms of the predictive brain in autism through flexibility tasks and fMRI, continuing to focus on sex and gender differences.

I am now a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Meng-Chuan Lai's team at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health ([CAMH](https://www.camh.ca) - Toronto, Canada), funded by a CIHR fellowship. My research here centers on understanding the heterogeneity of the autism spectrum, and to investigate how autistic females fits within this heterogenity. I am leveraging large databases and normative modeling to study both neurobiological and clinical data. Part of my research also deal with helath in autistic females.

## Participatory Research
Another key aspect of my work is the development of participatory research on autism in France. In this context, I co-led a participatory research group on parenting among autistic individuals, working alongside a Pr Caroline Demily ([iMind] - Lyon, France), a Marine Durbeucq who is a midwife, and two autistic mothers of autistic children. I am also involved in other participatory research projects, such as sensory perception in urban environments.

Additionally, I am part of a working group dedicated to creating a school for participatory research, aimed at providing a better framework for such initiatives and enhancing the education of both researchers and individuals affected by autism.
