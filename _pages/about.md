## Sex and Gender Differences in Autism
My research focused on autism, with a particular interest in understanding and characterizing sex and gender differences in the condition. 
Historically, autistic females have been underdiagnosed and under-researched, resulting in challenges in accessing appropriate care. 
By describing their specific profiles, we can help ensure better diagnosis and support for them.

During my PhD at the [Laboratory of Psychology and NeuroCognition (LPNC)](https://lpnc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en) in Grenoble, France, I studied these differences in the context of emotional face processing through the lens of the predictive brain model, under the [PREDEMAUT](/projects/001_Predemaut) project. 
My supervisors were Pr. Martial Mermillod (Grenoble, France) and Dr. Marie Gomot (Tours, France). 
I conducted behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) experiments.

In my first postdoctoral position at the LPNC, under the supervision of Pr. Monica Baciu and Dr. Marcela Perrone-Bertolotti, I further explored sex and gender differences in autism in relation to school participation during the [PARTDIAG-TSA](/projects/002_PartDiag_TSA) project. 
We also launched the [FLEXPREAUT](/projects/004_Flexpreaut) project, which aims to better understand the neural mechanisms of the predictive brain in autism through flexibility tasks and fMRI, continuing to focus on sex and gender differences.

I am now a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Meng-Chuan Lai's team at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health ([CAMH](https://www.camh.ca) - Toronto, Canada), funded by a CIHR fellowship. 
My research here centers on understanding the heterogeneity of the autism spectrum, and to investigate how autistic females fits within this heterogenity. This is the [INFORMHA-f](/projects/007_INFORMHA-f) project.
I am leveraging large databases and normative modeling to study both neurobiological and clinical data. 
Part of my research also deal with health in autistic females.

## Participatory Research
Another key aspect of my work is the development of participatory research on autism in France. 
In this context, I co-led the [PARAUTIS](/projects/003_Parautis) research project on parenting among autistic individuals, working alongside a Pr Caroline Demily ([iMind](https://centre-imind.fr/?lang=en) - Lyon, France), Marine Durbeucq who is a midwife, and two autistic mothers of autistic children. 
I am also involved in other participatory research projects, such as the [AUTISENCITE](/projects/005_Autisencit√©) project, related to the sensory perception in urban environments.

Additionally, I am part of a working group in the [Autism and NDD GIS](https://autisme-neurodev.org/en/) dedicated to creating a school for participatory research, aimed at providing a better framework for such initiatives and enhancing the education of both researchers and individuals affected by autism.
