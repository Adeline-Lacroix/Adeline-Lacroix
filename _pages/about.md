# About Me

Hello there! I’m Adeline, an enthusiastic researcher focused on understanding **sex and gender differences** as well as the fascinating **heterogeneity** of the autism spectrum.  

I completed my PhD and a first postdoctoral fellowship at the [Laboratory of Psychology and NeuroCognition (LPNC)](https://lpnc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en) in Grenoble, France, where I delved into behavioral and EEG experiments. 
Now, I’m diving into new adventures as a postdoctoral fellow at the Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute at [CAMH](https://www.camh.ca) in Toronto, Canada. 
I’m grateful to have developed collaborations with many talented scientists and to be involved in some truly exciting projects.  

I’m a strong advocate for **participatory research** in autism because I believe that the intersection of diverse perspectives, especially those of individuals directly involved in the issues at hand, is the best way to advance our understanding of complex topics. 
I’m currently working to foster this type of research in France. 
Related to that, I am particularly interested in developing practices that help us include individuals who may struggle to express themselves, such as those who are minimally verbal or have intellectual disabilities. 
This is a significant challenge that we must tackle.  

I have a deep commitment to **open science** practices, from pre-registration to sharing code, data, and materials. 
While I recognize there’s still much to learn, especially in balancing openness with data protection in health sciences, I find it essential to conduct rigorous and reproducible science. 
This belief has also sparked my interest in **methodology** and statistics. 
Additionally, I am dedicated to making research more accessible to a wide audience through both writing and oral presentations.  

Outside of my research, I advocate for autism as a member of the PAARI organization. 
I also enjoy sewing, am an animal lover and mom to a horse and a dog, and deeply care about environmental issues.  

I should also mention that I had quite a hectic journey before my current career. 
I first studied engineering, then arts, and then teaching. 
I worked as a primary school teacher and a special needs teacher before returning to study psychology and neuroscience.  

Thank you for stopping by my corner of the internet! I hope you discover something new and interesting as you explore my site.
