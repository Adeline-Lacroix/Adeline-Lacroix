Sex and gender differences in autism
======
I am a postdoctoral researcher working on autism. My main research interest is to better understand and characterize sex differences in autism. Indeed, young autistic girls and women have long been underdiagnosed and under-researched, leading to disadvantages in accessing care. Highlighting their specificities is essential to enable them to access diagnosis and quality support. During my PhD, I studied these differences in the context of emotional face processing, predictive brain models, and using behavioral and electroencephalography data. During my postdoctoral research, I continued this work using functional MRI. Additionally, as part of another project, I have also studied sex and gender differences in autism in terms of school participation.

Participatory Research
======
Another central aspect of my research is the development of participatory research on autism in France. In this context, I co-led, with a doctor, a midwife, and two autistic mothers of autistic children, a participatory research working group on the parenting of autistic individuals. I participate in other participatory research projects, including sensory perception in the city. Finally, I am a member of a working group aimed at developing a school for participatory research to provide a better framework for this type of research and to better educate researchers and those affected.
