It is crucial for me that research directly benefits the individuals involved, and to achieve this, it is important that our findings reach a wide audience. I am particularly passionate about providing high-quality information regarding autistic women, while also addressing the limitations of our current understanding. This was the primary goal of my book, but I also actively engage in delivering lectures, conducting interviews for various publications, and participating in TV and radio appearances. Below is a selection of my public engagement activities:

## Radio - France Inter
<p>I felt so grateful to have been invited by France Inter, the most famous French National Radio. It was a great opportunity to raise awareness on autism in females.</p>

## TV Interview - France 3 Alpes - L'instantané
<p>I am very thankful to have been invited by Aurélie Massait to present my book and the specificities of autistic women on the show L'Instantané on France 3 Alpes. It is a regional TV channel.</p>
