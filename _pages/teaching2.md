One key aspect of being a researcher is to transmit, share, and educate. This applies not only to research data but also to the scientific approach itself, which is essential in a world where beliefs sometimes tend to overshadow facts.  

In my work, this primarily involves supervising master's students during their internships. I strive to share my knowledge on autism, statistics and open science when possible, but I also learn a great deal from them.  

My outreach extends beyond academia through books, public lectures, and media appearances, where I am fortunate to be invited, allowing me to reach a broader audience and convey research-based messages.  

Finally, teaching students is another important part of this mission. Although teaching was once my primary profession—having first worked as an elementary school teacher and later as a specialized teacher in SEGPA (i.e., for student with learning difficulties)— I now wish for it to be a secondary role. While teaching is incredibly fulfilling, it is also quite demanding, particularly for someone like me. Nonetheless, I am happy to have taught and to continue teaching a few select courses that are especially meaningful to me.
