excerpt: "<div style='display: flex; align-items: center;'><p style='flex: 1; margin: 0; padding: 0;'>This book is the result of a long process, the conception of which began mentally before my PhD, and its realization took place during it, thanks to my encounter with UGA Editions, which gave me the impetus to bring this project to fruition. <br><br> In this peer-reviewed book (for a French speaking audience), I introduce a social, epistemological, and historical perspective, while providing an overview of psychological and neuroscience research on autism in females. I also reflect on the challenges and complexities of autism diagnosis. Expert insights and testimonies from autistic females are interwoven with clinical views and the latest scientific findings. <br><br> </p><img src='/images/book1.jpg' style='width: 200px; height: auto; margin-left: 10px;'></div>"
