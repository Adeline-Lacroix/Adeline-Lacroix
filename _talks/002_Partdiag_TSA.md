This study was conducted in the context of heterogeneous diagnostic pathways for French autistic children, their limited social and school participation, and a lack of comprehensive literature on the subject. The RHEOP (Registry of Childhood Disabilities and Perinatal Observatory in Isère and Savoie) provided an exhaustive sample of French autistic children by identifying all disabilities in children at the age of 7 across two departments.

The first objective was to assess the social, particularly school, participation of autistic children and adolescents aged 7 and 15 in Isère and Savoie, and to evaluate its determinants. Social participation was measured using the PEM-CY (Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth), covering all domains of the International Classification of Functioning.

The second objective was to describe the diagnostic pathways for these children. This in-depth analysis of diagnostic trajectories allowed for an evaluation of compliance with the 2018 HAS (French National Authority for Health) guidelines. The prevalence rate of ASD in adolescence was also estimated and compared with that in childhood.

The results of thes studies are unpublished yet, but a summary of the result in French can be found here.
