This project, led by Dr. Anne Ego and financially supported by the Fondation de France, is a collaboration between the [RHEOP](https://rheop.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr) (Child Disability Registry and Perinatal Observatory) and two laboratories in Grenoble: [TIMC](https://www.timc.fr/themas) and [LPNC](https://lpnc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr).

The study addressed the heterogeneous diagnostic pathways of children with autism spectrum conditions (ASC), their limited social participation, and the limited literature on the subject. 
The RHEOP can investigate a comprehensive sample of ASC cases by identifying all disabilities in children at age 7 across two French regions (Savoie and Isere).

The first objective was to assess the social participation, particularly in school, of children and adolescents aged 7 to 15 with ASD in Is√®re and Savoie. 
This was measured using the PEM-CY (Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth) scale, which covers all participation domains of the International Classification of Functioning.
Additionally, the study aimed to evaluate the determinants of participation, focusing on intellectual abilities, language, and executive functions. 
Secondary factors included gender, age at diagnosis, family socio-economic status (especially parental education level), and comorbidities, including behavioral disorders.  

The second objective, stil ongoing, is to describe the diagnostic pathway for cases identified by age 7 or later, between 8 and 15 years. 
This detailed analysis will assess compliance with the 2018 best practice guidelines from the French National Authority for Health (HAS). 
Additionally, the prevalence rate of ASD in adolescence, which is still underexplored in France, will be estimated, along with its evolution from childhood.
