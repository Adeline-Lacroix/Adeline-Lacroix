This project is the result of a collaboration between the <a href="https://rheop.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr">RHEOP</a> (Child Disability Registry and Perinatal Observatory) and two laboratories in Grenoble: the <a href="https://www.timc.fr/themas">TIMC</a> and the <a href="https://lpnc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr">LPNC</a>.

At the LPNC, it involves <a href="https://www.perrone-bertolotti.fr">Dr Marcela Perrone-Bertolotti </a>, <a href="https://cerca.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/en/membres/morgane-burnel-2/">Dr Morgane Burnel</a> and Pr Monica Baciu <a href="https://lpnc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr/monica-baciu">Pr Monica Baciu</a>. 
From the RHEOP side, it involves <a href="https://www.timc.fr/anne-ego">Dr. Anne Ego</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pauline-Occelli-2">Dr Pauline Ocelli</a> and Marie David.
This project has been financially supported by the <a href="https://www.fondationdefrance.org/fr/">Fondation de France</a>. 

The study addressed the heterogeneous diagnostic pathways of autistric children, their limited social participation, and the limited literature on the subject. 
The RHEOP can investigate a comprehensive sample of autistic children by identifying all disabilities in children at age 7 across two French regions (Savoie and Isere).

The first objective was to assess the social participation, particularly in school, of autistic children and adolescents aged 7 to 15 in Is√®re and Savoie. 
This was measured using the PEM-CY (Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth) scale, which covers all participation domains of the [International Classification of Functioning](https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/international-classification-of-functioning-disability-and-health).
One of the main aim was to evaluate the determinants of participation, focusing on intellectual abilities, language, and executive functions. 
Secondary factors included gender, age at diagnosis, family socio-economic status (especially parental education level), and comorbidities, including challenging behaviors.  

The second objective, still ongoing, is to describe the diagnostic pathway of autistic youths.
This detailed analysis will assess compliance with the 2018 best practice guidelines from the French National Authority for Health (HAS). 
Additionally, the prevalence rate of ASD in adolescence, which is still underexplored in France, will be estimated, along with its evolution from childhood.
