While research on autistic adults has grown, few studies focus on their experiences as parents. 
Existing research indicates that autistic parents, particularly women, find parenting fulfilling, though they often face challenges in communicating with healthcare professionals and fear judgment or social service intervention due to their diagnosis. 
This study is carried out by the [IMind centre](https://centre-imind.fr/?lang=en) and aims to compare the perspectives of various professionals (healthcare, education, justice) and autistic parents on parenting, to address the training needs of professionals and clarify the specific needs of autistic parents.

Importantly, the goal of the study was determined by autistic adults. 
Indeed, this study is participatory, co-constructed with autistic individuals in an egalitarian manner. 
We decided to cinsider autistic participants as co-researchers, to enhances the relevance and impact of this research. 
The team began to work together in early 2021. It includes six members: the Pr Caroline Demily (psychiatrist) , Marine Dubreucq (midwife) and representant of the autism community and/or autistic mothers : Dani√®le Langloys, Magali Pignard, Adeline Lacroix.
Guillaume Lio also joined the team in 2023.

This research was presented at the scientific day co-organized by the Autism and NDD (Neurodevelopmental Disorders) Interest Group (GIS) and the iMind center on March 17, 2022.
