While research on autistic adults has grown, few studies focus on their experiences as parents. 
Existing research indicates that autistic parents, particularly women, find parenting fulfilling, though they often face challenges in their daily lives and in communicating with healthcare professionals.
In addition, they often fear judgment or social service intervention due to their diagnosis. 
The study aims to compare the perspectives of various professionals (healthcare, education, judicial) and autistic parents on parenting, to address the training needs of professionals and clarify the specific needs of autistic parents.

Importantly, the goal of the study was determined by autistic adults. 
Indeed, this study is participatory, co-constructed with autistic individuals in an egalitarian manner. 
In all the study process, the autistic adults included in the research team were considered as co-researchers, to enhances the relevance and impact of this research. 
The team began to work together in 2020-2021. It includes six members: the Pr Caroline Demily (psychiatrist) , Marine Dubreucq (midwife) and three representant of the autism community and/or autistic mothers : Dani√®le Langloys, Magali Pignard and Dr. Adeline Lacroix.
Dr. Guillaume Lio also joined the team in 2023.

This research was presented at the scientific day co-organized by the Autism and NDD (Neurodevelopmental Disorders) Interest Group (GIS) and the iMind center on March 17, 2022.
